/* 
In this Javascript file you will need to declare variables used in html file
and create a function that adds an 'active' class to a tab and the 
corresponding elements that go along with it.

So the tab that is clicked should display the corresponding info and image and 
hide all other information.
*/

/* Step 1. Declare all variables (tabs,images,info)

**** Note: You should be using querySelectorAll to put all elements with the
 same class in their own array; array of tabs, array of imgs, 
 array of infoCards ****
 */




/*Step 2. Create a function that takes in the array of tabs and 
loops through each tab and adds an 
event listener 
*** Note: the function should have the individual tab and index 
of tab as parameters ***
*/




/*Step 3. Inside the event listener loop through each array and remove 
active class from all elements */








/* Step 4. Add the 'active' class to the tab that is clicked on 
and its corresponding images and info card using the index */
